INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [D:/Users/trialley/Desktop/LS_CPU_LAB/6_single_cycle_cpu/single_cycle_cpu.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/single_cycle_cpu_display_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/single_cycle_cpu_display_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

WARNING: [Constraints 18-5210] No constraints selected for write.
Resolution: This message can indicate that there are no constraints for the design, or it can indicate that the used_in flags are set such that the constraints are ignored. This later case is used when running synth_design to not write synthesis constraints to the resulting checkpoint. Instead, project constraints are read when the synthesized design is opened.
